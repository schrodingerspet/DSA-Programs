# Data Structures and Algorithms Concepts

This document covers 11 fundamental data structures and algorithm concepts, providing explanations, examples, and time complexity analysis.

## 1. Count Digits
**Concept:** Count the number of digits in a given number.

**Explanation:** For any integer, we want to find how many digits it has. For example, 12345 has 5 digits, and 9876 has 4 digits.

**Approach:**
1. Keep dividing the number by 10 until it becomes zero, counting the divisions.
2. Alternatively, you can convert the number to a string and count the characters.

**Example:** For 12345:
- Divide: 12345 → 1234 → 123 → 12 → 1 → 0
- Count: 5 divisions → 5 digits

**Time Complexity:** If `n` is the number, the time complexity is `O(log₁₀(n))` since we keep dividing by 10.

## 2. Palindrome
**Concept:** A palindrome is a number or string that reads the same forward and backward.

**Explanation:** For example, 121 is a palindrome because reversing it gives 121, but 123 is not a palindrome because reversing it gives 321.

**Approach:**
1. Convert the number or string to a reversed form and check if it's the same.
2. You can use two-pointer techniques to compare the first and last characters.

**Example:**
- Input: 1221 → Reverse: 1221 → Result: Palindrome
- Input: 123 → Reverse: 321 → Result: Not a palindrome

**Time Complexity:** The complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of digits or characters.

## 3. Factorial
**Concept:** The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all integers from 1 to `n`. It's denoted by `n!`.

**Explanation:** For example, `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`, and `3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6`.

**Recursive Approach:**
```
fact(n) = n * fact(n-1)
```

**Example:** `fact(5) → 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity is `O(n)` because you have to multiply all numbers from 1 to `n`.

## 4. Count Trailing Zeros
**Concept:** Count the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a number.

**Explanation:** The trailing zeros in a factorial are caused by factors of 10. Since `10 = 2 * 5`, and there are usually more 2s than 5s, the number of trailing zeros is determined by how many times 5 is a factor.

**Approach:** Count how many multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., are in `n`.

**Example:** For `100!`, the number of trailing zeros is calculated as:
- `100 / 5 = 20`
- `100 / 25 = 4`
- `100 / 125 = 0`
- Total = 24 trailing zeros

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity is `O(log₅(n))`.

## 5. GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
**Concept:** The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both.

**Explanation:** For example, for 12 and 15, the GCD is 3.

**Euclidean Algorithm:**
```
gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b) until b becomes 0.
```

**Example:**
```
gcd(12, 15)
= gcd(15, 12)
= gcd(12, 3)
= gcd(3, 0) → GCD is 3
```

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity is `O(log(min(a, b)))` due to repeated division.

## 6. LCM (Least Common Multiple)
**Concept:** The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

**Explanation:** For example, for 4 and 6, the LCM is 12.

**Relation with GCD:**
```
lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)
```

**Example:**
```
lcm(4, 6)
= (4 * 6) / gcd(4, 6)
= 24 / 2 = 12
```

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity is the same as GCD, i.e., `O(log(min(a, b)))`.

## 7. Prime
**Concept:** A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Explanation:** For example, 2, 3, 5, 7 are prime numbers, but 4, 6, 8 are not.

**Approach:** Check if a number has divisors between 2 and √n. If no divisors exist, it's prime.

**Example:**
- For 7: It has no divisors other than 1 and 7 → Prime
- For 8: It's divisible by 2 → Not prime

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity is `O(√n)` for each number.

## 8. Prime Factors
**Concept:** Prime factorization breaks down a number into its prime factors.

**Explanation:** For example, 84 = 2² * 3 * 7.

**Approach:** Divide the number by its smallest prime factor repeatedly.

**Example:** For 84:
- Start with 2: 84 / 2 = 42, 42 / 2 = 21, 21 / 3 = 7 (7 is prime)
- Prime factors: 2² * 3 * 7

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity is `O(√n)`.

## 9. All Divisors
**Concept:** Find all divisors of a number.

**Explanation:** For example, the divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.

**Approach:** Loop from 1 to √n, checking divisibility. Each divisor `i` gives two divisors: `i` and `n/i`.

**Example:** For 28, the divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity is `O(√n)`.

## 10. Sieve of Eratosthenes
**Concept:** An efficient algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given limit `n`.

**Explanation:** It works by marking non-prime numbers starting from the first prime (2).

**Approach:**
1. Start with 2, mark all its multiples as non-prime.
2. Move to the next unmarked number, and repeat.

**Example:** For `n = 10`, the primes are 2, 3, 5, 7.

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity is `O(n log log n)`.

## 11. Power
**Concept:** Calculate the result of `x` raised to the power `y` (i.e., `x^y`).

**Explanation:** For example, `2^3 = 8` and `5^4 = 625`.

**Efficient Approach (Exponentiation by Squaring):**
- If `y` is even: `x^y = (x^2)^(y/2)`
- If `y` is odd: `x^y = x * (x^2)^(y/2)`

**Example:**
```
2^10 = (2^5)^2 = (32)^2 = 1024
```

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity is `O(log y)`.
